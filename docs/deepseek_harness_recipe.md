# DeepSeek Harness Recipe

This page shows how to use DeepSeek Harness as a reproducibility assistant for
`ml-quant-trading`. The goal is narrow: run the existing benchmark and
validation workflows, preserve the evidence bundle, and avoid overstating what
the result proves.

DeepSeek Harness is not required by this repository. Treat the checkout as an
ordinary workspace that an agent can read, run, and audit.

An optional thin plugin lives at
[`initial-d/dsh-plugin-mlquant-benchmark`](https://github.com/initial-d/dsh-plugin-mlquant-benchmark).
The first release is
[`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/initial-d/dsh-plugin-mlquant-benchmark/releases/tag/v0.1.0).
It only wraps the benchmark, artifact validation, and report-drafting workflow;
it does not add a trading agent, model-provider configuration, market-data
access, or an agent runtime dependency to this repository.

The plugin is listed in
[`awesome-dsh-plugin`](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com/#development--runtime), so
DSH users can discover the benchmark path from the public plugin index and then
land back on this repository with a concrete report template.

## Why This Fits

`ml-quant-trading` already has agent-friendly properties:

- deterministic synthetic quick start;
- protocol v1 CPU benchmark with fixed panel, seed, repetitions, and thread
  counts;
- machine-readable benchmark JSON;
- public-data validation docs;
- explicit Reality Check boundaries;
- structured issue templates for reproduction reports.

That makes it a useful workspace for testing whether an agent can reproduce a
quant research workflow without turning benchmark output into trading claims.

## Setup

Open the repository as a DeepSeek Harness workspace, then ask the agent to read:

```text
AGENTS.md
README.md
docs/reality_check.md
docs/benchmarking.md
docs/agent_reproducibility.md
```

Install the development dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

If you want DSH-native tool calls instead of asking the agent to run shell
commands directly, install the optional plugin from GitHub:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:initial-d/dsh-plugin-mlquant-benchmark
```

Then add it to a Cordis composition:

```yaml
- id: mlquant-benchmark
  name: dsh-plugin-mlquant-benchmark
```

The plugin registers:

- `mlquant_benchmark_v1_cpu`;
- `mlquant_read_benchmark_json`;
- `mlquant_validate_benchmark_json`;
- `mlquant_draft_github_issue`.

## Run The Benchmark Protocol

Ask the agent to run the fixed CPU benchmark:

```bash
python scripts/benchmark_tensor_factors.py \
  --device cpu --n-dates 750 --n-stocks 1000 --window 20 \
  --repeat 10 --warmup 3 --threads 1 --interop-threads 1 --seed 42 \
  --json-out artifacts/benchmark-v1.json
```

The agent should preserve:

- exact command;
- commit SHA;
- OS, CPU, Python, and PyTorch versions;
- thread settings;
- raw Markdown table;
- `artifacts/benchmark-v1.json`;
- warnings, failures, or unusually unstable cases.

The benchmark is an engineering throughput diagnostic. It is not a trading
performance result and should not be compared as a controlled hardware ranking
unless the environments are controlled.

## Suggested DeepSeek Harness Prompt

```text
Read AGENTS.md, docs/benchmarking.md, and docs/reality_check.md.
Run the protocol v1 CPU benchmark exactly as documented.
Return an evidence bundle with commit SHA, command, environment, raw table,
JSON path, and any unstable cases. Do not describe the result as trading alpha
or as a controlled hardware ranking.
```

## Optional Validation Prompt

```text
Read AGENTS.md, docs/reality_check.md, and docs/public_data_validation.md.
Run only the requested public-data validation workflow. If public data fails or
falls back to synthetic data, report that explicitly. Keep costs, turnover,
data source, and caveats next to the headline result.
```

## Good Output

A useful DeepSeek Harness run produces an issue-ready report:

```text
Repository: initial-d/ml-quant-trading
Commit: <sha>
Workflow: protocol v1 CPU benchmark
Command: <exact command>
Environment: <OS / CPU / Python / PyTorch / CUDA availability>
Artifact: artifacts/benchmark-v1.json
Result: <raw table>
Caveats: <warnings, instability, thermal notes, data limits>
Interpretation: engineering benchmark only; no trading claim
```

Post the result through the benchmark issue or reproduction report template
rather than opening a new benchmark format.

If the run was performed through DeepSeek Harness, use the dedicated
[DeepSeek Harness benchmark report](https://github.com/initial-d/ml-quant-trading/issues/new?template=deepseek_harness_benchmark.yml)
so the prompt, transcript, benchmark artifact, and discovery path stay together.

See the seed DSH benchmark report in
[#61](https://github.com/initial-d/ml-quant-trading/issues/61). The plugin
challenge is tracked in
[`initial-d/dsh-plugin-mlquant-benchmark#1`](https://github.com/initial-d/dsh-plugin-mlquant-benchmark/issues/1).

## Plugin Boundary

The optional plugin is intentionally small. It is useful when contributors want
repeatable DSH-native tool calls for:

- protocol v1 CPU benchmark;
- benchmark JSON validation;
- issue-body drafting.

The plugin should not become a trading-decision layer. Public-data validation
report packaging or benchmark-board update drafts can be added later only if
repeated reports show that the extra surface is worth maintaining.
