# Community Benchmark Board

This page tracks benchmark reports shared by users. Submit results with the
`Benchmark result` issue template.

For trading-workflow validation rather than tensor throughput, use
[`public_data_validation.md`](public_data_validation.md). That path reports
walk-forward baselines, transaction costs, slippage, turnover, and drawdown.
It also writes a copy-ready `submission.md` and machine-readable JSON files for
community reports.

## How to Submit

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
python scripts/benchmark_tensor_factors.py \
  --device cpu --n-dates 750 --n-stocks 1000 --window 20 \
  --repeat 10 --warmup 3 --threads 1 --interop-threads 1 --seed 42 \
  --json-out artifacts/benchmark-v1.json
```

Then open a benchmark issue, paste the printed Markdown table, and attach the
generated `artifacts/benchmark-v1.json`. `make benchmark` is an equivalent
shortcut on systems with GNU Make.

DeepSeek Harness users can use the
[`dsh-plugin-mlquant-benchmark`](https://github.com/initial-d/dsh-plugin-mlquant-benchmark)
helper and submit through the
[DSH benchmark report template](https://github.com/initial-d/ml-quant-trading/issues/new?template=deepseek_harness_benchmark.yml).
DSH reports should preserve the prompt, transcript or summary, JSON artifact,
and the same caveats as shell-only runs.

The command above is the canonical protocol v1 CPU run. It fixes the synthetic
panel at 750 dates x 1000 stocks, the 20-day window, seed 42, 3 warmups, 10
measured repetitions, and both PyTorch thread pools at one thread. Optional GPU,
larger-panel, and multi-thread runs should be reported separately.

For larger panels:

```bash
python scripts/benchmark_tensor_factors.py \
  --device auto \
  --n-dates 1500 \
  --n-stocks 3000 \
  --window 20 \
  --repeat 10 \
  --warmup 3 \
  --threads 1 \
  --interop-threads 1 \
  --seed 42
```

| Device | Case | Mean | Std | Peak CUDA memory |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cpu | `cs_rank(close)` | 77.4 ms | 2.8 ms | - |
| cpu | `ts_mean(close,20)` | 23.8 ms | 2.3 ms | - |

| cpu | `ts_corr(close,returns,20)` | 152.3 ms | 9.2 ms | - |

| cpu | `compute_legacy_set(6 factors)` | 551.0 ms | 45.9 ms | - |

This is the first comparable v1 report. Run the same command on another machine
and submit the complete output through the benchmark issue template.

### Community Protocol v1: Apple M4

Environment and raw results are preserved in [issue #59](https://github.com/initial-d/ml-quant-trading/issues/59).
This is a community-submitted, CPU-only protocol v1 report from a fresh checkout.
It is included for reproducibility and hardware context, not as a controlled
ranking against the maintainer result.

Environment:

- Contributor: [@sergio12S](https://github.com/sergio12S)
- Commit: `2a91c6b199d3f3608bbebacb36addb37949200b9`
- Protocol: `v1`
- Machine: Apple M4, 10 logical CPUs
- OS: macOS 26.5.2 arm64
- Python: 3.10.16
- PyTorch: 2.13.0
- PyTorch threads / interop threads: 1 / 1
- CUDA available: false
- Synthetic panel: 750 dates x 1000 stocks
- Window: 20
- Warmup / repeat: 3 / 10
- Seed: 42
- Exact command: the canonical protocol v1 command shown above

| Device | Case | Mean | Std | Peak CUDA memory |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cpu | `cs_rank(close)` | 24.4 ms | 218.0 us | - |
| cpu | `ts_mean(close,20)` | 7.1 ms | 499.6 us | - |
| cpu | `ts_rank(close,20)` | 15.9 ms | 489.3 us | - |
| cpu | `ts_corr(close,returns,20)` | 36.9 ms | 4.7 ms | - |
| cpu | `ewma(close,0.05)` | 3.6 ms | 158.5 us | - |
| cpu | `compute_legacy_set(6 factors)` | 136.3 ms | 6.6 ms | - |

The contributor repeated the command on the same machine: `ts_corr` moved from
36.9 ms to 43.4 ms and its standard deviation rose from 4.7 ms to 12.1 ms,
while the other cases stayed within roughly 10%. The report also notes that a
historical `ts_rank` difference across commits is confounded by benchmark-script
and runtime changes. Keep both caveats attached to the numbers; do not infer a
PyTorch or hardware speedup from them.

### DSH Seed Protocol v1: Intel Core i7-1255U

Environment and raw results are preserved in [issue #61](https://github.com/initial-d/ml-quant-trading/issues/61).
This is a maintainer seed report produced through DeepSeek Harness. It is
included to verify the agent-assisted run, validation, and report path; it is
not an independent machine report or a controlled hardware ranking.

Environment:

- Contributor: Maintainer via DeepSeek Harness
- Commit: `960de1953f8589467456ad92bf9e4f978c3f0f1b`
- Protocol: `v1`
- Machine: Intel Core i7-1255U, 10 cores / 12 threads
- OS: Windows 11 10.0.26200
- Python: 3.14.4
- PyTorch: 2.11.0+cpu
- PyTorch threads / interop threads: 1 / 1
- CUDA available: false
- Synthetic panel: 750 dates x 1000 stocks
- Window: 20
- Warmup / repeat: 3 / 10
- Seed: 42
- Exact command: the DSH-assisted protocol command in issue #61

| Device | Case | Mean | Std | Peak CUDA memory |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cpu | `cs_rank(close)` | 209.5 ms | 33.4 ms | - |
| cpu | `ts_mean(close,20)` | 37.6 ms | 6.1 ms | - |
| cpu | `ts_rank(close,20)` | 177.3 ms | 61.0 ms | - |
| cpu | `ts_corr(close,returns,20)` | 295.8 ms | 151.5 ms | - |
| cpu | `ewma(close,0.05)` | 51.7 ms | 9.0 ms | - |
| cpu | `compute_legacy_set(6 factors)` | 756.9 ms | 131.5 ms | - |

The report records the DSH prompt, the corrected command after an accidental
trailing argument, the generated JSON artifact path, and caveats. Treat the
numbers as evidence that DSH can preserve the benchmark workflow and artifact
boundary, not as a performance claim.

## Pre-Protocol Machine Snapshots

The following results predate protocol v1. They did not pin PyTorch thread pools
or software versions and therefore must not be used as a controlled CPU ranking.

## What Makes a Good Benchmark Report

- The command is copy-pasted exactly.
- Protocol v1 is present in the environment table.
- Both PyTorch thread counts are recorded.
- The commit SHA is included.
- CPU and GPU names are included.
- CUDA availability is stated.
- The result table is pasted without editing numbers.
- Any unusual conditions are documented, such as shared GPU, thermal throttling, or low memory.

## Why This Helps

Benchmark reports help users answer practical questions:

- Does GPU help for my panel size?
- Which operations dominate runtime?
- Is performance sensitive to PyTorch or CUDA version?
- What hardware is enough for a student or research workflow?
